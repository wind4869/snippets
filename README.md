# Snippets
A plugin of IntelliJ Platform adding support for code snippet management.  
It reads Java files from a directory, then displays them in IDE like Bookmarks.  
You must put your Java files in the directory of $HOME/workspace/snippets-java.  
After installing it from "Plugins -> Marketplace", press "Command + F4" to use.  
You can use my Java snippet collections: `git clone https://github.com/wind4869/snippets-java.git`.
